# Active Development Context - Multiplayer Road Fighter

## Current Work Focus:
*   Project initialization and foundation setup phase
*   Implementing comprehensive project documentation and planning
*   Setting up development environment and initial project structure
*   Preparing for core development phase with database and backend implementation

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
*   **Database Schema Design:** Finalizing table relationships and indexing strategy for optimal performance
*   **Whop Platform Integration:** Determining best practices for iframe embedding and platform-specific requirements
*   **Anti-cheat Architecture:** Evaluating server-side validation approaches vs. client-side monitoring
*   **Mobile Performance:** Balancing visual quality with performance on lower-end mobile devices
*   **Payment Flow Security:** Ensuring PCI compliance while maintaining user experience
*   **Real-time Latency:** Optimizing WebSocket communication patterns for sub-100ms response times

## Recent Changes:
*   Completed comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) with all feature specifications
*   Finalized system architecture documentation with component relationships and data flow
*   Detailed technical specifications including technology stack and security considerations
*   Created detailed task backlog with dependencies and priority assignments
*   Installed and configured rulebook-ai for structured project documentation
*   Researched Whop platform APIs and integration requirements thoroughly

## Next Steps:
1. **Initialize Development Environment** (High Priority)
   - Set up TypeScript/React/Node.js project structure
   - Configure package.json with all required dependencies
   - Set up development tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Jest)

2. **Database Foundation** (High Priority)
   - Implement PostgreSQL database schema with Prisma
   - Set up database migrations and seed data
   - Create initial data access layer

3. **Basic Express Server** (High Priority)
   - Implement Express.js server with TypeScript
   - Set up basic middleware and error handling
   - Create health check and basic API endpoints

4. **Whop SDK Integration** (High Priority)
   - Install and configure Whop SDK
   - Implement user authentication flow
   - Test Whop platform embedding requirements

5. **Game Engine Foundation** (Medium Priority)
   - Port existing Road Fighter game mechanics to new architecture
   - Set up HTML5 Canvas rendering system
   - Implement basic game physics and controls

## Immediate Action Items:
- [ ] Create package.json with complete dependency list
- [ ] Set up Docker development environment
- [ ] Initialize Prisma with database schema
- [ ] Create basic Express server structure
- [ ] Test Whop SDK integration locally
